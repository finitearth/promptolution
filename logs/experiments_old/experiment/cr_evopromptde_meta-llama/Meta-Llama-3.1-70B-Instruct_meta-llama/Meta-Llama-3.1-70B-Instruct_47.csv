1. Identifying the different parts between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2:
Prompt 1: As a sentiment classifier, categorize the phrase with a positive or negative outlook, taking into account the context and sentiment, based on the given sentence.
Prompt 2: Given a tweet, classify it as having a positive or negative sentiment.

Different parts:
""As a sentiment classifier, categorize the phrase"" vs ""Given a tweet, classify it""
""with a positive or negative outlook, taking into account the context and sentiment"" vs ""as having a positive or negative sentiment""
""phrase"" vs ""tweet""
""based on the given sentence"" (absent in Prompt 2)

2. Randomly mutate the different parts:
""As a sentiment classifier, categorize the phrase"" -> ""You are tasked to evaluate the statement""
""phrase"" -> ""social media post""
""with a positive or negative outlook, taking into account the context and sentiment"" -> ""according to its emotional tone and language cues""
""based on the given sentence"" -> ""in the provided text""
