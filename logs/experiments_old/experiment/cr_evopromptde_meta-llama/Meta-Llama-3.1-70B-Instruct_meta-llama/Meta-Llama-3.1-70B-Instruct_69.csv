1. Identifying the different parts between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2:

Prompt 1: You are a sentiment classifier. To do this, you must first understand the meaning of the sentence and any relevant context. And then you should classify it as positive or negative.
Prompt 2: Determine the sentiment of a product review based on a given text, positive or negative.

""sentence"" vs ""product review based on a given text""
""classify it as positive or negative"" vs ""positive or negative""

""sentence"" -> ""review text""
""classify it as positive or negative"" -> ""label it as positive, negative""
