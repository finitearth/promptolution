1,"Let's follow the instructions step-by-step to generate a better prompt.

**Step 1: Identify the different parts between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2**

Prompt 1: Please perform Question Classification task. Given the question, assign a label from ['Description', 'Entity', 'Expression', 'Human', 'Location', 'Number']. Return label only without any other text
Prompt 2: Classify this sentence based on the provided categories: Description, Entity, Expression, Human, Location, or Number.

Different parts:

""Please perform Question Classification task. Given the question"" vs ""Classify this sentence""
""assign a label from"" vs ""based on the provided categories""
""Return label only without any other text"" vs (no equivalent part in Prompt 2)

**Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts**

""Please perform Question Classification task. Given the question"" -> ""Your goal is to analyze the query""
""assign a label from"" -> ""categorize into one of the following""
""Return label only without any other text"" -> (delete this part, as it's not essential)

**Step 3: Crossover the different parts with Prompt 3 and generate a final prompt**

Prompt 3: Using the following categories",0.3
