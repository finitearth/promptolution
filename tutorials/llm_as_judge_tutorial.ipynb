    "Discover a powerful tool for evolving and optimizing your LLM prompts. This notebook provides a friendly introduction to one of Promptolution's most advanced features: LLM as a Judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the standard getting_started notebook shows how to optimize for classification tasks, this guide will focus on something different. We'll optimize prompts for a creative task where there's no single \"correct\" answer: *Finding an optimal argument for a statement*!"

    "## Intro\n",
    "In traditional machine learning and prompt optimization, we often rely on labeled data. For a classification task, you need an input (x) and a corresponding ground-truth label (y). The goal is to find a prompt that helps the model predict y correctly.\n",
    "But what if your task is more subjective? How do you \"label\" things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The quality of a generated argument?\n",
    "- The creativity of a story?\n",
    "- The helpfulness of a summary?\n",
    "- The persuasiveness of an essay?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where LLM as a Judge comes in. Instead of relying on a pre-defined dataset of labels, we use another powerful Language Model (the \"judge\") to score the output of our prompts. The process looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate prompt is used to generate a response (e.g., an argument).\n",
    "A \"judge\" LLM then evaluates this response based on the task provided and assigns a score.\n",
    "Promptolution's optimizer uses these scores to identify which prompts are best and evolves them to generate even better responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this approach is its flexibility. While you can provide groundtruths (in case there is a correct answer) and let the LLM judge itself if both the prediction and the correct answer are equivalent - you don't need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "*New to Promptolution? If you haven't seen our classification tutorial yet, check out `getting_started.ipynb` first! It covers the basics of prompt optimization with simpler tasks like text classification. This notebook builds on those concepts but tackles more complex, subjective tasks.*"
