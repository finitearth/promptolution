## Release vX.X.X
### What's changed

#### Added features:
* We welcome CAPO to the family of our optimizers! CAPO is an optimizer, capable of utilizing few-shot examples to improve prompt performance. Additionally it implements multiple AutoML-approaches. Check out the paper by [Zehle et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005) for more details (yep it's us :)).
* Eval-Cache is now part of the ClassificationTask! This saves a lot of LLM-calls as we do not rerun already evaluated data points.
* Similar to the Eval-Cache, we added a Sequence-Cache, allowing to extract reasoning chains for few-shot examples.

#### Further changes:
* Classificators is now called Classifier.
* Fixed multiple docstrings and namings of variables.
* Added new pipelines
* Simplified testing and extended to CAPO.
