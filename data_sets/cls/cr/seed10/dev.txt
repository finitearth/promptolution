nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .	1
not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
4 . play n-gage games on it .	1
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .	1
update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend 's house really reinforced that ! .	1
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
photos are pretty darned good ! .	1
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .	1
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .	1
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .	1
the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .	1
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
i must have gotten a good one .	1
its compact and has rounded edges .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .	1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .	1
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .	1
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? .	1
the movie mode is also working great .	1
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .	1
it has great incredibility .	1
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .	1
it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access .	1
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .	1
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .	1
a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .	1
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .	1
the sound is very nice .	1
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )	1
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .	1
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .	1
the battery has a long life .	1
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .	1
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .	1
the champ works great .	1
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .	1
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .	1
it looks sleek and modern .	1
installation was as near automatic as can be .	1
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .	1
really happy with this little camera .	1
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .	1
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .	1
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
- outstanding signal reception	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .	1
the phone itself is pretty nice .	1
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .	1
this unit comes with the usb/firewire cable as a standard item now .	1
great phone . . .	1
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .	1
i never get dropped calls .	1
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .	1
- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .	1
i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .	1
the radio and voice recording are nice .	1
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .	1
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .	1
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .	1
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee .	1
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .	1
i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that one ! . " i was willing to shell out	1
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance .	1
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 ! .	1
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .	1
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .	1
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .	1
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .	1
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	1
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .	1
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .	1
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .	1
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad	1
the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .	1
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .	1
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .	1
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .	1
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .	1
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .	1
works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia .	1
i really liked the price . . .	1
colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from .	1
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .	1
after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .	1
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well .	1
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .	1
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004 .	0
t610 supports only midi files .	0
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	0
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .	0
also , not liking the gel case .	0
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :	0
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .	0
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .	0
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners .	0
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .	0
also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .	0
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .	0
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .	0
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .	0
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .	0
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .	0
warning ! . the windows " remove program " feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program .	0
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .	0
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .	0
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .	0
if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .	0
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	0
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .	0
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .	0
cons breaks easily .	0
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .	0
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .	0
the interface took a little getting used to .	0
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .	0
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .	0
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .	0
and the battery life is bad ! .	0
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .	0
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds - they 're just not that comfortable .	0
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .	0
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .	0
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .	0
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one .	0
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .	0
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .	0
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the " free picture and video messaging " offered by service provider .	0
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates .	0
now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age .	0
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
i am glad that i do not work for norton .	0
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .	0
- some features in the user interface	0
i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .	0
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
features : really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature .	0
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .	0
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
so , right out of the box i had issue .	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	0
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .	0
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .	0
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele's ) is horrendous .	0
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .	0
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .	0
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70% of my calls using it .	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	0
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .	0
one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .	0
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .	0
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .	0
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .	0
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .	0
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	0
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .	0
the volume .	0
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .	0
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
the only problem is the battery life .	0
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
