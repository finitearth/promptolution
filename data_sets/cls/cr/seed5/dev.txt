. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	1
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .	1
the i-pod is the best thing i have ever used .	1
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	1
and it is very easy to clean .	1
great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .	1
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .	1
all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .	1
this one is really great .	1
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .	1
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .	1
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .	1
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .	1
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	1
its well made and user friendly .	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	1
it works with a minimum of fuss .	1
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .	1
it has it all .	1
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .	1
there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	1
my experience with installation was quite good .	1
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .	1
the sound is just fine .	1
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .	1
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail ! .	1
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .	1
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .	1
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	1
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now .	1
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	1
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .	1
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .	1
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .	1
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .	1
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .	1
the hard case they give with it must work well .	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .	1
+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .	1
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .	1
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .	1
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? .	1
i have had no problems with the phone .	1
it 's also easy to empty out .	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .	1
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .	1
the movie mode is also working great .	1
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .	1
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	1
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .	1
1 . record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro .	1
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .	1
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .	1
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .	1
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .	1
regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! .	1
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .	1
the diaper champ is the best ! .	1
- outstanding signal reception	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .	1
really happy with this little camera .	1
the quality is superb .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	1
and we still love it ! .	1
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .	1
excellent diaper disposal unit .	1
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
versatile and stylish .	1
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .	1
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .	1
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .	1
i love the bluetooth ; . easy to use with a wireless abra headset .	1
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .	1
aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it ! .	1
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	1
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .	1
photos are pretty darned good ! .	1
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	1
the battery does not last 12 hours .	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	0
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .	0
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .	0
i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .	0
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
avoid this product at all costs .	0
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $300 myself .	0
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .	0
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .	0
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games .	0
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .	0
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	0
also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .	0
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .	0
there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters .	0
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .	0
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	0
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .	0
this product is absolutely not ready for release .	0
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	0
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	0
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
other than that it is all the same except the new updates .	0
cons breaks easily .	0
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .	0
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	0
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	0
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	0
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts .	0
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	0
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .	0
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .	0
we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party " asking " protective covers for an extra thirty bucks .	0
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
a bit disappoint on that ! .	0
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
*	0
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .	0
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than phone " functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .	0
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .	0
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .	0
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
but those 2 come up every time .	0
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	0
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .	0
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	0
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .	0
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope .	0
however , in my mind , $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months .	0
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .	0
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	0
the user support service isn 't too great either .	0
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .	0
if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .	0
customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .	0
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .	0
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .	0
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .	0
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	0
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	0
no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient	0
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .	0
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .	0
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .	0
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates .	0
- no proprietary headset jack	0
they didn 't know what the problem could be .	0
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .	0
seems the " program scan " feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .	0
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
the biggest problem is the installation .	0
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004 .	0
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .	0
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations .	0
