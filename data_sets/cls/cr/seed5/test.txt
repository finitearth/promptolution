if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .	0
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .	0
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .	1
"the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that "" creative "" branding is all over the place within it ."	1
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
booting up my computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	0
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .	0
"a lot of "" fragments "" were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders ."	0
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .	1
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .	0
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .	0
"the "" movies "" last about 5 seconds ."	0
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .	1
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .	0
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .	0
overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .	1
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .	1
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .	1
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .	1
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .	1
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .	0
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	0
as for bluetooth , no problems at all .	1
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	1
it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options .	1
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .	1
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .	0
in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .	0
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	0
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .	0
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .	0
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	1
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .	0
its quiet .	0
i see many other reviews that say the same . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone ! .	0
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .	1
downloads are a snap and quick .	1
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .	0
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age .	0
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .	1
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .	0
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .	1
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .	1
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones .	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
it also works just fine for international calls .	1
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .	1
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .	0
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	0
cons : no am/fm radio tuner -- something a large number of compete tors are doing	0
5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables .	1
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .	1
i am glad that i do not work for norton .	0
only if we could get one camera in it . .	0
firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .	1
great camera , great investment ! .	1
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .	0
i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .	0
sound quality ? . phenomenal .	1
6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .	1
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .	1
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .	1
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .	0
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
i mean , they 're short ! .	0
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .	1
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .	0
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .	1
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .	1
"that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the "" add to cart "" button already ! ."	1
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .	1
the vibration is not top .	0
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .	1
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .	0
using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient .	1
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .	0
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	0
i am bored with the silver look .	0
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .	1
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .	1
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ! .	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .	1
the setup was very easy .	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .	0
the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone	1
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."	0
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .	1
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .	0
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .	1
norton support is completely pathetic .	0
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .	1
it was a symantec error .	0
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .	1
1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .	0
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
"we constantly got "" windows virtual memory low "" error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes ."	0
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system ! .	0
its also smaller , and gets more looks .	1
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online .	0
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .	1
"my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of "" brick . "" *"	0
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .	1
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .	0
this product has virtually all the same installation problems .	0
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .	1
best in class .	1
on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .	1
"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! . shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" ."	1
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .	0
10 great price for all the features .	1
really easy to use .	1
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .	0
the phone itself is pretty nice .	1
the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .	1
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .	1
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .	0
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera .	1
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .	1
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version ! .	0
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .	0
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid .	1
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )	0
all in all , this is a wonderful device .	1
it would not hang up on calls .	0
t610 supports only midi files .	0
the only problem is the size of the keys .	0
4 . the build is just right .	1
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .	1
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 ! .	0
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .	0
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .	1
"if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $105 . 50 per minute and blame you for "" abusing "" your ipod ."	0
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge .	1
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; . they look as though they were built out of lego's .	0
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .	0
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .	0
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .	0
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .	0
especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .	0
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .	0
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .	1
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	1
battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .	0
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .	1
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .	0
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault .	0
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance .	1
- solid , high-quality construction	1
"warning ! . the windows "" remove program "" feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program ."	0
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
holy cow ! . it really does scratch easily ! .	0
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .	0
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .	0
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .	0
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .	1
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .	0
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .	1
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .	0
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .	0
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .	1
fits well in hand in trouser pockets .	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .	1
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .	0
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .	1
- some features in the user interface	0
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .	1
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .	0
works pretty well .	1
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .	1
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .	0
