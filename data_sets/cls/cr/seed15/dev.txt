i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .	1
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .	1
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .	1
setup in xp was instant and intuitive .	1
the earbud headphones are really nice .	1
i think it 's great .	1
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .	1
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .	1
in addition it is very easy to setup .	1
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	1
the battery has a long life .	1
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .	1
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .	1
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .	1
the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .	1
moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .	1
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
the movie mode is also working great .	1
the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .	1
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .	1
love the speaker phone .	1
the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone	1
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	1
give each friend a different ringtone .	1
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .	1
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .	1
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .	1
this is the best phone i have seen .	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect .	1
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of usb wires .	1
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! . ! . ! . ! . i love this phone ! . ! . ! .	1
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
high quality video and pictures rock ! .	1
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .	1
so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .	1
i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .	1
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .	1
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .	1
if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .	1
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .	1
it definitely keeps the smell out .	1
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .	1
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	1
if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .	1
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .	1
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .	1
seriously ! . i love it ! .	1
a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .	1
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .	1
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .	1
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .	1
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .	1
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .	1
i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .	1
what impressed me most was the sound .	1
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .	1
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	1
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .	1
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .	1
it 's so small .	1
if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .	1
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .	1
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .	1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .	1
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .	1
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .	1
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .	1
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .	1
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .	1
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .	1
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .	1
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .	1
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .	1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool .	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	1
the quality is superb .	1
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .	1
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .	1
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .	1
the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .	1
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .	1
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .	1
if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .	0
norton support is completely pathetic .	0
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .	0
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .	0
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .	0
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .	0
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .	0
the biggest problem is the installation .	0
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	0
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .	0
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .	0
can 't get easier than that ! .	0
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .	0
so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .	0
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .	0
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .	0
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	0
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .	0
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004 .	0
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .	0
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .	0
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )	0
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .	0
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .	0
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	0
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	0
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .	0
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .	0
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches .	0
only then did i learn the truth -- this phone does not work with palm pdas ! .	0
the interface took a little getting used to .	0
you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .	0
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .	0
i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs . the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a " customer priority id number . "	0
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .	0
2 ) phone is awfully slow .	0
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .	0
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .	0
avoid this product at all costs .	0
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners .	0
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .	0
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .	0
when talking the voice is not very clear .	0
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .	0
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .	0
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .	0
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than phone " functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .	0
you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .	0
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues .	0
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
seems the " program scan " feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .	0
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .	0
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	0
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .	0
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .	0
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .	0
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .	0
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .	0
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .	0
the only problem is the size of the keys .	0
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong .	0
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .	0
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .	0
namely , it wouldnt sync .	0
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .	0
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .	0
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele's ) is horrendous .	0
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .	0
so , don 't buy this or upgrade .	0
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .	0
the battery does not last 12 hours .	0
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .	0
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70% of my calls using it .	0
the customer support is pathetic .	0
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .	0
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .	0
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .	0
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .	0
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .	0
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	0
